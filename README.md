<h2/>Purpose and original interest</h2>
  This project was pitched as a type of video game asset management system with the goal of using a relational database to model several aspects of the Pokémon franchise. Our goal as a development team was to integrate a clean and simple UI with some simple “game-like” mechanics to help us learn about full stack development and how backend interact with frontend throughout the development process.
